            <h2>Sherby's back!</h2>
            <p>Hey guys!</p>
<p>As most of you already know, it’s Sherbrooke’s University’s turn to host the Computer Sciences Games in march 2015!  We already have soooooo many ideas to make next year’s event one of the best (if not THE best)!</p>
<p>This year, we plan to offer you a lot of social interaction opportunities during the event, whether it is between you guys or with our sponsors on-site. We also aim to expand the diversity of participating universities and finally, we are bringing back two competition categories from the deads while adding three new ones which we think will be really cool! (You will have to wait to know them, though. This is just a teaser post after all! ;-) )</p>

  In order to become the best in a field you have to know how to execute with skill and elegance. As masters will say, it’s through repetition that we gain a true and just understanding of our actions. During 3 hours you will have to apply yourself in solving problems that are too long or complex to finish with elegance. Only when finished, and your neurons have cooled down, will you be able to grasp the true lesson behind this exercise. Of course, don’t stop there and continue to repeat the exercise for weeks so you can become a master of the code.

              <p>
  At school, budding developers are trained to know a little of everything.  In a work setting, devs need to hone in on specific areas. Radialpoint's Relay Programming is offering you the best of both worlds –with a challenging mix of data processing, web app development and automated testing. The goal: complete the relay in 3 hours without any help from your team members (telepaths forbidden).

      <h2 class="heading-bordered">Theme - FRIDAY 0XD (Superstitions)</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
  This year, we are very committed to put the theme forward, so we decided to create this section to help you get some inspiration and to satisfy your eagerness to learn more about superstitions!
</p>
<h3>The number 13</h3>
<p>
  The number 13 is well-known to bring bad luck, but have you ever wondered why? The origin would actually be linked to the number of guests to the last supper and its adverse consequences. On the contrary, In China and Egypt, the number 13 brings good luck. The number 4 is considered as the bad luck number in the East Asia because of its sonority, which is the same as death in Japanese, Korean and Chinese.
</p>
<h3>Friday</h3>
<p>
  Friday bringing bad-luck also has religious origins. It may comes from the fact that the day the Christ died on the cross and the redemption day were both Fridays.
</p>
<h3>The black cat</h3>
<p>
  A black cat crossing your path is not only a sign of bad luck but can be an omen of death. During the middle ages, it was believed that black cats were demons and would block your connection to god and your entrance to heaven if crossing your way. Other versions of this superstition say that a cat walking towards you will bring you good luck, but it will take your luck away if it is walking away. In England and Ireland, black cats are rather known to bring good luck.
</p>
<h3>The broken mirror</h3>
<p>
  This superstition comes from the belief that a distorted reflection of oneself is the sign of an imminent disaster. In antique Greece, it was believed that the reflection of a person was the representation of his soul. Therefore, a distorted reflection meant a damaged soul. A broken mirror was therefore a bad omen. To break one will bring you seven years of bad luck.
</p>
<h3>The horseshoe</h3>
<p>
  If an horseshoe is hanged the opening towards the sky, than it shall bring you good luck. However, hanging it upside down would make your luck fall.
</p>
<h3>Opening an umbrella under a roof</h3>
<p>
  It is said that opening an umbrella under a roof, brings bad luck. Some story says that in Egyptian times, umbrellas were used to protect oneself from the heat of the sun. They believed that opening the umbrella inside could offend the God of Sun.  Other stories propose that this superstition gets its origin from the 18th century, in London, when waterproof umbrellas were very brutal to open. This was because of their mechanism, and opening one inside could cause injuries and break objects.
</p>
<h3>Presenting the bread upside-down</h3>
<p>
  During the Old Regime (the two centuries preceding the French Revolution), bakers were keeping the bread reserved to the hangman upside-down. It is said that this way of presenting the bread would attract the devil. In France, it has become cultural to cross the back of the bread.
</p>
<h3>Passing under a ladder</h3>
<p>
  Passing under a ladder is not only somewhat dangerous but will also bring you bad luck. While ladders were symbolizing the gallows in medieval time, it was believed that a person walking under a ladder would face his own death by hanging. It was also believed that the top of a ladder, forming a triangle with the object on which it is placed, was a spot haunted by spirits. Moreover, many religions associate the triangle shape to something sacred (Pyramids, the Holy trinity, etc.). Breaking a triangle (by passing under a ladder, by example) can be considered blasphemy.
</p>
<h3>Other superstitions</h3>
<p>
  You should not trim your nails nor pass the broom after 6:00 PM.  It is said that it could attract the souls of the dead inside your home. In case you would still take the risk, you could throw some salt over your left shoulder to repel them. Make sure not to spill the salt though, because that would attract the devil.
</p>
<p>
  If you ever give a toast to someone, you would get bad luck not looking into his eyes.  It may be not that bad if, while not making eye-contact with your interlocutor, you see a rainbow, a flying star or a lady bug, as they are known to bring good luck to the one observing them.
</p>
<p>
  If you ever come to walk under a ladder by accident, you could avoid bad luck by crossing your fingers until you see a dog. If you fear to never see a dog until losing patience, you could knock on wood to avoid disappointment (while keeping your fingers crossed, obviously). You could also make the wish of seeing a dog while throwing a coin in a fountain.  If you ever get tired of waiting and you yawn, don’t forget to put your hand in front of your mouth. Otherwise a demon could possess you, or you could simply lose your soul.
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
  While during the CS Games 2015 - Friday 0XD you may accumulate bad omens and a lot of years of bad luck, get surrounded by evil spirits, lose your soul, etc. We recommend you to have on you one of the following (or all of them):  A 4-leaf clover, a horseshoe, a rabbit leg, the number 7 and salt (be careful not to spill it).
